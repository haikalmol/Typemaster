## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

There are some breakpoints that still need to be addressed (especially between 390 and 515px), just to keep the design consistent. I will make sure those details are fixed in the next version.
